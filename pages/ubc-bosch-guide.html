								<p>
                                You need health insurance to live and work in Germany. 
								If you're a non-EU citizen, this is a crucial component of applying for 
								your residence permit, which allows you to work in Germany.
								</p>
                                <h4 id="ams"> 1.1.1 Qualifying for AMS Student Care </h4>
								<p>
                                AMS Student Care health insurance coverage is part of your student fees at UBC. 
								Part of this coverage includes travel health insurance. However, this health insurance 
								is only active (regardless of if you paid for it with your co-op tuition) if you are paying 
								for MSP (provided by the providence of British Columbia) or a similar basic private health 
								insurance for BC.
								<br>
								<br>
								You only qualify for MSP if you are living as a residence in BC. 
								If you leave BC for up to 6 months, this is ok. You can continue to pay for MSP online and you will still qualify for the travel health insurance with AMS Student Care. 
								If you are away from BC for longer than 6 months, you will need to purchase basic private health insurance for BC in order to qualify for the travel health insurance with 
								AMS Student Care once you are gone for longer than 6 months.
								</p>
                                <h4 id="leaving_ubc_else"> 1.1.2 Other Options </h4>
								<p>
								If you receive healthcare through a family member such as a parent or guardian, 
								you can speak with them to see if you will be covered overseas for the duration of your stay. 
								One example of healthcare that can apply overseas is Pacific Blue Cross.

                                <h3 id="visa"> 1.2 Visa </h3>

                                <h4 id="us_citizens"> 1.2.1 US citizens </h4>
								<p>
                                As a US citizen, you have two options to apply for your visa:
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Option One</b>: Before moving to Germany, schedule an appointment with the Toronto German Consulate, 
								and fly to Toronto with all the required documentation for your visa application. 
								You will need x,x,x,x,x, and x (to be edited soon). The German Consulate will process your information and hold onto your passport until you are 
								issued your visa. This typically takes a few days, unless there are issues with your application. This option is the best for ensuring you can begin your work term at Bosch on time.
								<br>
								<br>
								NOTE: Scheduling an appointment early with the Toronto German Consulate is key. Appointments book quickly and you may end up having to leave UBC during exams and end of term to take care of your visa. 
								This can be extra stressful and not fun. So save yourself the stress and book it early.
								<br>
								<br>
								NOTE: Ok. I'm a US citizen though. Why do I need to go all the way to Toronto to apply for a visa? The simplest answer is that this is the way the German government decided to set up their consulates. 
								You must apply for visas and permits in your country of residence (most likely Canada) and not your country of citizenship. Not all consulates process visa and permit applications (Vancouver's consulate does not), so Toronto is where you gotta go. 
								This is your first taste of German bureaucracy - hold on tight, it's gonna be a wild ride.
                                <br>
								<br>
								<b> Option Two </b>:Arrive in Germany at least a month before you are scheduled to begin your work term at Bosch. As a US citizen, you can reside in Germany for up to 90 days without a visa. Upon arriving, immediately contact the Ausländerbehörde (aka the Foreigners Authority) 
								to set up an appointment for your residence application. There is a specific phone number you can call based on your last name or you can submit an email requesting an appointment. To find this number and more information about setting up an appointment, visit this website. 
								It is incredibly important when you request an appointment that you stress the time sensitivity of your situation. Include that you are a US citizen, a student trying to start an internship, and when you are scheduled to start employment. Typically, appointments can take months to schedule. 
								But by pleading your case in your first communications, they will usually work to schedule your appointment within a month.
								<br>
								Once you have an appointment scheduled, you will receive a list of documents to submit. These may include:
								<br>
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Antragsformular (application form),</li>
								<li>Praktikumsvertrag (employment contract),</li>
								<li>Zustimmung der Agentur für Arbeit (ZAV) (approval from the employment agency),</li>
								<li>aktueller Wohnraumnachweis vom Eigentümer unterzeichnet und Kopie Mietvertrag 
								(your housing certificate signed by the person owning the property and your rental contract),</li>
								<li>and aktueller Krankenversicherungsnachweis (proof of health insurance coverage in Germany).</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
								<br>
								
								Typically, you will be asked to submit these documents via email prior to your appointment date.
								<br>
								NOTE: Make sure your employment contract lists the correct start and end dates of your work term. Bosch is responsible for obtaining approval from the 
								employment agency. This approval is only granted for the dates within your work contract and therefore your residence permit is only granted for the 
								dates within your work contract.
								<br>
								NOTE: The proof of health insurance coverage in Germany can be difficult to obtain. In some cases, you may need to have your insurance company sign a form. Once you receive the form from the German authorities, 
								immediately begin the process of contacting your insurance to sign the form. Without the signed form, they will not grant you a residence permit regardless of the other documentation you provide to prove your health insurance.
								<br>
								To the appointment, bring with you:
								<br>
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li>a printed version of the documents you were asked to submit if possible,</li>
								<li>your passport, </li>
								<li>two biometric photos (the restrictions for these photos can be found here),</li>
								<li>and the fee for the permit (60€ - 75€).</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3 id="looking_for_house"> 1.3 Looking for housing before arriving </h3>
								<p>
								From our experience, it is very hard to look for a housing if you're not present in Germany 
								(and don't speak German). This is because you cannot visit the apartement before paying for the deposit. 
								So, there will be a trade off: go throught an agency and pay more for what you get, or do it on your own and 
								risk to be scammed. Both options will be discussed in [2.1 Find a place]. 
								Our recommendation would be to fly to Stuttgart and stay there a week to look/visit rooms and apartments.

								<p>
                                Arriving in Stuttgart can be stressful. Most of us are not Europeans and don’t speak German (yet!). 
								This section contains tips and resources to help you ease into German life with minimal issues. 
								For some of us, it took a whole stressful month to settle down - avoid this by reading these sections. 
								We recommend arriving in Stuttgart one to two weeks before your internship starts. 
								This allows you time to find housing, establish a bank account, and set-up a German phone number.
								</p>
                                <h3 id="find_place"> 2.1 Find a place </h3>
								<p>
                                Before you begin looking for a place to stay, get familiar with your commute and transportation options 
								to Bosch and around Stuttgart (Refer to section <a href="#commuting"> 2.2</a>).
                                This will help you establish what areas of town you want to look for housing in. 
								It is encouraged to house hunt in-person instead of from the Canada. Scams can happen,
								but are much less likely if you are able to visit a place in-person before signing anything.
								<br>
								For example, we visited an attractive place in Renningen mid-May, just to learn during the visit that the rental period began 
								in early August.

                                <h4 id="stuttgart_lonberg"> 2.1.2 Stuttgart and other areas </h4>
								<p>
                                Living in and around Stuttgart can be expensive. 
								More than half of our salary can go for rent if we're not careful. Places near downtown (Stadmitte) are EXTREMELY expensive. 
								Renningen, the town closest to Bosch’s campus, is a great location. Unfortunately, 
								housing is very expensive there too. This is due to two main economic factors: the Bosch campus 
								(1200 employees) and the American military base. Many people are moving in and out of Renningen regularly 
								causing rents to skyrocket.
								<br>
								We recommend Leonburg due to its environment and location. A place near Wie-der-Stadt, an S-bahn station two stops away from Renningen, is also a good option.
								</p>
                                <h4 id="renting"> 2.1.3 Renting </h4>
								<p>
								Finding a place to live in Stuttgart when you’re 5000km away can be quite challenging. Where to start? 
								Who to contact? How? We’ll try to answer these questions in this section.
                                </p>
								<h5 id="student_housing"> Student Housing </h5>
								<p>
								Student dorms is a very cheap option. However, they are also extremely difficult to get. 
								Check out this website for more information, listings, and applications. There are a number of dorms around Stuttgart city centre and in 
								other cities like Ludwigsberg. You must apply online. Although it says applications should be made 6 months in advance, 
								there is still hope if you’re looking for housing in the middle of the semester (i.e. January). After applying online, email them and sound as desperate as possible. 
								Email address can be found in the contact section of the website. Email address of Neckarstasse 172 : ADD HERE. This has been successful for a few of us so far. 
								If you are in Germany, go to their office and talk to them. Office address: ADD HERE.
								
								<br>
								Pros: 
								<ul>
								<li> Cheaper than anything else in Stuttgart. Prices range from 230€ - 400€ including utilities </li>
								<li>Usually have large communal kitchens. This can be the best place to throw parties and play beer pong</li>
								<li>Everyone living here is a student, so you get invited to parties and meet new people</li>
								<li>Safe</li>
								<li>Don't have to deal with landlords</li>
								<li>All locations are near the city center</li>
								</ul>
								Cons:
								<ul>
								<li>You will have to share the kitchen and the bathroom with 5-8 other roommates</li>
								<li>Rooms are small (like UBC-Gage)</li>
								<li>You can only rent for 6 months (Some of us have had luck renting for longer by going to the office and talking to them)</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<h5 id="bosch_housing"> Bosch Housing </h5>
								<p>
								Bosch sent you a list of <i>available accomodations</i> in your contract (if you havn't read it yet)... 
								in German. But hey... it still helps and is a great place to start.
								</p>
								<h5 id="own_apartment"> Own Apartment </h5>
								<p>
								Renting your own studio is awesome. You don’t have to share your kitchen and shower with roommates. 
								You don’t have quiet hours. YOU CAN BE FREEEEEEEEE! However, it can quickly become expensive and… 
								our small salary won’t make it to the end of the month. There are two options when you look for your own 
								studio/room. Option one: look on sites such as the German <i><a href="https://www.wg-gesucht.de/">craiglist</a></i> 
								and <i><a href="https://www.uniplaces.com/">Uniplaces</a></i>. 
								Option two: hire an agency to do the scouting for you.
								</p>
								
								<h5 id="rental_agencies"> Rental Agencies </h5>
								
								<p>
								One might think that contacting an agency would be a good move… and is right. Agencies are a good resource to help you find a reliable place. 
								They have quality standards and are only renting places where they have a contract with the owner.
								
								<br> 
								
								Pros: 
								<ul>
								<li><b>Speaks English</b> - The communication can be easily done in English. The person will ask you what you are looking for, your price ranges, and expectations. 
								They will then send you offers that fits your needs. </li>
								<li><b> Quality Assurance </b> -  The apartment offered through an agency will be clean and quality. They cannot falsely advertise. 
								If an apartment looks decent online, it’s probably worth visiting. </li>
								<li><b>Reliable</b> - The rental dates, the rental price, etc… What you see in the online ad will be accurate. Therefore, you have little chance of visiting an apartment that will only be available 
								two months after your visit. </li>
								<li><b>Payment</b> - You will pay rent directly to the agency. The agency then pays the landlord. This limits your chances of being scammed 
								(More details in the “Do it yourself” section [link to paragraph]). </li>
								</ul>
								Cons:
								<ul>
								<li><b>Expensive</b> - The general rule is that you’ll lose 2-3 months of rent a year. In other words, if you decide to rent an apartment with an agency, 
								they’ll increase the prices so they can profit of 2-3 extra months worth of rent. </li>
								<li><b>Deposit</b> - Once you sign a rental agreement, you’ll need to pay a deposit and the first month of rent before you move in. Be prepared to have enough 
								money to pay the deposit and first month before you get your first Bosch paycheck. </li>
								<li><b>Paperwork</b> - The agency will want proof you’ll be able to pay rent for the full extent of your internship (+ proof of visa/identity). Why is that? In Europe, removing tenants is incredibly difficult, even if the tenants are refusing to pay their rent. The process of evicting a tenant takes 1-2 months. A rental agency wants to prevent a situation where they enter a rental contract with someone who stops paying rent after a few months. 
								While the paperwork is a hassle, it protects both the tenant and the landlord.</li>
								<li><b>Online</b> - Most rental agencies operate online and through emails. 
								They do not encourage meeting in-person to discuss your needs and expectations.</li>
								</ul>

								Link to some agencies:

								</p>
								<h4 id="house_registration"> Housing registration </h5>
								<p>
								Once you’ve found a place to live, signed a rental agreement, and paid your deposit, it’s time to register your housing. 
								Regardless of if you’re a German citizen or an international citizen, everyone must register their place of 
								residence within Germany. To register, bring your passport and signed rental contract to your closest 
								Rathaus (civil office - kind of like a city hall). By completing your housing registration, you’ll also 
								receive an Identifikationsnummer (the German version of a Canadain SIN or an American SSN) in the snailmail.
								See section X for why this is important. If you don’t receive your Identifikationsnummer in a timely manner, 
								you can pay the Rathaus another visit and directly request it. They should be able to print it out for you 
								on the spot if your housing registration was completed during an earlier visit.
								<br>
								NOTE: You will need to deregister before leaving Germany.

                                between a 30min and a 1h30 long commute is easy to make (at least for me). The first

                                allows one to have more free-time. The condition in which you commute is also important.

                                It allows people who does not want to spend 300€ for a student travel pass to still be
                                able to
                                live in Stuttgart Downtown.

                                Feel free to (try to) contact other interns at other location to ask for it. If it

                                SPTLr is another ressource from Bosch to help employees to commute to work. SPTLr is a
                                car share
                                app that allows anyone using it to either register as Driver or Guest. That allows
                                employees
                                living in remote areas to commute together in order to reduce the costs (and carbon
                                footprint).
                                The app is relatively new and still need improvement as not many people is using it.
                                However
                                that can still be a ressource worth looking into.
                                <br />
                                PROS:
								<ul>
                                <li> Car share: you can register as driver to reduce your expenses or guest to join a
                                        driver
                                </li>
                                <li> Locations: buses/train can be annoying from time to time and the car share system
                                        is
                                        allowing to bypass that </li>
                                <li> Social: it can be good to force you to practice German, every day for your commute
                                </li>
                                <li> Money: pay directly from the app so you don't have to do anything in this regard
                                </li>
								</ul>

                                CONS:
								<ul>
                                <li> Users: not many </li>
                                <li> App: app design isn't the most intuitive and it is also relatively new </li>
                                <li> Registration: you need a Bosch email address, you can register to it only after
                                        starting
                                        work </li>
								</ul>

                                SPLTr will probably become onof the best commuting car sharing apps for the Bosch
                                community.

                                It is important to know that the cost to travel in zone 1 is 2.50€ (2.37€ if you pass by

                                (~11.00€ for a two way traject). The cheapest option is to travel in zone one to take

                                city-link.

                                <h4 id="driving"> 2.2.4 Driving </h4>

                                For thoses are tempted to use a car around Stuttgart there are few things you need to
                                know.
                                First of I would say it is worth for many reasons (cheaper than commuting, SPLTr,
                                travels to
                                black forest/europe/etc., hollidays with other interns, live closer to work, etc.).
                                However,
                                Germany has some STRICT ecological restriction regarding diesel cars allowed in certain
                                areas.

                                There is an environment restriction for diesel cars. Some diesel cars are not allowed to
                                drive
                                in certain zones. The fine is 80€. This is rather serious as in some areas the air
                                quality is
                                extremely bad. The restriction is about the particle emissions (how the engine burns the
                                fuel)
                                so there is nothing we could do about it.
                                <br />
                                <b> IMPORTANT NOTE: The restriction is ONLY about diesel cars. Gasole cars can drive
                                        freely no
                                        matter how fuel efficient they are.</b>
                                <br />
                                Currently the only diesel cars allowed to drive in Stuttgart/Leonberg are thoses with a
                                EURO-class of 5 or more, however the change from "class 4" to "class 5" is relatively
                                new so
                                there is a transition period (I am currently driving an EURO-class 4 and do not have
                                problems
                                with it). For the sake of the environment we'll highly recommand anyone who plans on
                                buying/renting/using a car in this area to follow the environmental norms.

                                You need to open a German bank account to get paid. No, you cannot use your
                                        Canadain/US/French account instead. Banking in German is a bit different than in
                                        Canada.
                                        There’s no Interac Transfer and the process is a bit more complicated (i.e. more
                                        paperwork). Below are some options with the pros and cons that we’ve learned
                                        along the
                                        way.

                                While working at Bosch, you can open a Deutsche Bank account for free. Make an
                                        appointment
                                        online or via phone at a branch close to you. Make sure to bring along your
                                        passport,
                                        Bosch work contract, and residence registration to the appointment. In roughly 2
                                        meetings with an advisor, you can have a fully working bank account with a debit
                                        card
                                        ordered.

                                <b>NOTE:</b> If you’re a US citizen, you’ll also need your SSN and will be asked to
                                        fill out
                                        a tax form for the US government. Ask to fill out this form during the
                                        appointment. You
                                        won’t need to go through the hassle of printing the form, mailing it in or
                                        stopping by
                                        the specific bank branch again.

                                <h5> Commerzbank </h5>
                                From our experiences, Commerzbank is very frustrating to open an account with. While
                                        you can
                                        try and open an account online without an appointment, you will end up having to
                                        prove
                                        your identity (bring your passport) at a PostBank or in-person unless you’re a
                                        German
                                        citizen. If they need to send you your ATM card more than once, they will charge
                                        you 5€
                                        each time they send it. They will also charge you when they send you
                                        correspondence

                                        If you feel the need to open an account with Commerzbank here are some tips so
                                        hopefully
                                        you don’t get ripped off:
										<ul>
                                        <li> Be prepared to provide an address where you can receive mail at and you are
                                                registered with the German authorities. This is how you receive your ATM
                                                card.
                                                In Germany, mail is delivered based on the name on the postbox. If
                                                you’re name
                                                is not on the postbox, provide a care-of (CO) name that is on the
                                                postbox along
                                                with the address </li>
                                        <li> As soon as you have access to your online banking, opt out of receiving
                                                mail
                                                through the post. This means they will send you correspondence online
                                                and won’t
                                                charge you for it </li>
												</ul>
                                

                                <h3 id="phoneplan"> 2.4 Phone Plan </h3>
								Phone service is not available on Renningen Campus for most compagnies!! Most people have to go outside 
								campus to find service. 
								Vodaphone, however, works and even provides 3G.
								
                                <h4 id="pre_paid"> 2.4.1 Pre-paid </h4>
								
								Unless you’re planning to stay in Germany for two or more years, you’ll need a pre-paid phone card. 
								With your passport, you can purchase a pre-paid SIM card. 
								Below, we recommend a few companies we’ve had experience with.
								
                                <h4 id="best_companies"> 2.4.2 Best companies </h4>
								Please be carefull with using your phone outside Germany (Italy, France, Poland, etc...) as it might be crediting you for any data/texts send. I spend 2 weeks outside 
								Germany and got credited 50€ without knowing for using my data. If you ever decide to go for an 
								'international EU plan', please remember that some countries (Monaco, Switzerland, UK, etc...) are not EU members 
								and fees can apply!
								
								<h5 id="O2"> O2 </h5>
								At the time of writing this, O2 offers pre-paid cards with limited calls and texts, and various amounts of data 
								(3GB is about 15€ a month). These plans are nice because you’ll have phone service and data in Germany and 
								any other EU country if you’re planning to travel. Once you have a German bank account, you can easily pay 
								for your next month of service by texting 56656 from your phone with the O2 phone number. 
								This number will send you information to transfer money. You can then ensure the money was transferred by 
								checking your online O2 account. On O2's website, go to Mein O2 -> login to your account -> Guthaben und 
								Aufladen -> Guthabendetails -> Aufladungen und Abbuchungen. This page should provide you with a history of 
								the transactions on your account. Transfers may take several days (yay for the German banking system), 
								so check with your bank to ensure the transfer was processed if you don’t see the payment on your O2
								account.
								
								<br>
								
								NOTE: O2 offers a smartphone app. It boasts a lot of features and convenience - 
								like paying for your service, checking the remaining amount of data you have, etc. Unfortunately, 
								you can only download it to your Apple device if you’re Apple account location is set to Germany. 
								This is very hard to do it you have a foreign credit card linked to your Apple account.
								
								<h5 id="vodaphone"> Vodaphone </h5>
								
								his is also a good option since it works on the Renningen campus. 
								You can have 2GB Data with unlimited texting for 10€ a month. 
								When your 2GB of 'High Speed Data', you'll still be able to access 'low speed data (E)'.

                                <p> The first day of work your supervisor will send you an “intern welcome” email. In
                                        this
                                        email, there will be a link to a form that you NEED to submit to HR as soon as
                                        possible
                                        in order to get paid (PLEASE FILL THE GERMAN FORM AS THE ENGLISH FORM DOESN’T
                                        COUNT FOR
                                        HR). This form will ask you for German SIN that you will get at the civil office
                                        after
                                        registering your housing. Why is this “SIN” important? Part of it refers to your
                                        tax
                                        class. In germany there are different tax classes, and without a tax number

                                        the civil office you’ll be charged at the highest rate. And yeah… losing 120€ at

                                        of your first month isn’t the most pleasant experience. So please, make sure you

                                <h3 id="food"> 3.2 Food - Intern Discount </h3>

                                Don’t worry about bringing lunch with you. At Renningen, there is a cafeteria where
                                everyone
                                eats. It’s open weekdays from 11:30-14:30. As an intern, you receive a discount of X.XX€
                                on
                                every meal. Depending on what you choose to eat, you typically spend 1.30€ to 3€ per
                                meal. You
                                pay for food with your Bosch ID card. Your balance can be refilled with cash at the
                                kiosk
                                directly outside the cafeteria.

                                <h4>Cafe</h4>

                                There’s also a cafe on campus where you can purchase breakfast, lunch and snacks. Sadly,
                                no
                                discounts are available for interns here but you can use cash and your Bosch card for
                                purchases.

                                <h4>Coffee and Snacks</h4>

                                There’s free coffee, milk and sugar in your office! You can make yourself espresso or
                                coffee
                                crema. Be prepared to have the machine notify you German to refill the water tank or
                                dispose of
                                the coffee grinds every once in a while. There’s also coffee machines where you can get
                                fancy
                                coffee by paying with your Bosch card. Vending machines around campus offer snacks for
                                purchase
                                with your Bosch card as well. These vending machines can also be used to check your
                                balance on
                                your Bosch card before heading to the caf for lunch.

                                <h4> Fun fact </h4>

                                On the building 131 floor 2, if ever you forget to lock your computer and someone sees
                                it. He'll
                                send an email to the whole floor saying you will bring cake. Yeah... don't forget to
                                lock your
                                computer or you'll have to bring cake for everyone!


                                <h3 id="flex_time"> 3.3 Flex time/Vacation </h3>

                                Each day, you are expected to work 7 hours and take 45 minutes for lunch and breaks. Due
                                to
                                German law, you may not work longer than 10 hours. Your working time is tracked when you
                                tap
                                your card upon arrival to Bosch and when you tap out at the end of the day. You can find
                                all of
                                this documented in the your Time Management page within Bosch’s internal HR pages. You
                                can also
                                adjust your break time to up to an hour.

                                Flex time is the time management schedule the interns are working with. In order to
                                avoid paying
                                interns for overtime, Bosch will instead “store” the hours you have to be redeemed. An
                                example
                                would be: if one day you work 10h, the other day you can leave work early after 5h30 in.
                                As long
                                as the combined time for two days is 15h30, you will be fine. That also means that if
                                you work
                                10h per day (monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday), you can have a 3-day weekend by
                                using
                                your flex time instead of your vacation time! In the Time Management page, when you take
                                a day
                                off of work, you create an entry and specify if the time off is vacation or flex-time.

                                Depending on the length of your internship, you’ll receive some vacation days which can
                                be found
                                in your contract.

                                experience and time in Germany immensely. It will take time, energy, and extra effort.
                                However,
                                you will learn to think differently and connect with others in ways you may not be able

                                through our experiences.

                                        <li>If traveling on a budget, look for hostels. Usually reasonably priced, you
                                                can get a
                                                bed and a place to shower, sometimes breakfast too. If you’re lucky, you
                                                may
                                                meet some fellow travelers and make some friends. Pro tip: most hostels
                                                have
                                                lockers to secure your stuff while you’re out exploring. Bring a lock
                                                with you
                                                to take advantage of this.</li>
                                        <li> Pack light. Most transportation options limit the number of bags you can
                                                take and
                                                their size and weight. Be aware of this or you may have to pay extra.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Schedule your transportation and accommodations early. This may seem like a
                                                no-brainer, but you can save quite a bit moola with a little advanced
