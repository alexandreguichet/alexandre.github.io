                        <p>Level is a puzzle game. The player act on the environment to move a ball, collect tokens and
                                advance through 3 different levels.</p>
                        <p>The player can use 3 different skills: move, jump and attack. The victory condition is to
                                collect all tokens and/or defeat enemies and then access the exit. The failure condition
                                is either losing all hps or falling off ground.</p>
                        <p>Three different levels are currently available. The first level aims to teach the movement
                                mechanic. The second level aims to teach the jump mechanic. The third level introduce
                                the health and the attack mechanics with a small mini-boss at the end.</p>
                        <p>The game mechanics are simple as I wanted to focus on the level design to provide the player
                                a unique experience. The game can still be improved with nearly infinite possibility of
                                level creation.</p>
                        <p>In this post, I will explain the creation process of the game. How the idea came, what I
                                wanted to achieve and what challenges I faced.</p>

                        <p>The creation of this game started two years ago. I studied Level Design through games and
                                books and I
                                remember being amazed by a simple concept. It came from the online book “The How’s and
                                Why’s of
                                Level Design” by Sjoerd “Hourence” de Jong:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"The utilisation of computers is not intuitive to humans.
                                        We must
                                        learn how to use it."</strong></p>
                        <p>I came to realisation that it was true: all games, no matter what they are, have a tutorial
                                to
                                introduce the player to the game mechanics. All informatics tools have their own
                                tutorial,
                                documentation, etc…</p>
                        <p>I wanted to know if it was possible to create a game intuitive enough that someone can play
                                it
                                naturally without being frustrated (I consider that games like “Mario Bros” achieved
                                this
                                objective).</p>
                        <p>This was the beginning of the design of “Level”.</p>

                        style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right top, #ffffff, #fcfcfc, #f8f8f8, #f5f5f5, #f2f2f2);">
                        <h2 id="Design">Design (Goals):</h2>
                        <p>As a beginner Level Designer, I was clueless on how to design a game. I decided to create
                                some
                                precepts that I will follow:</p>
                        <p>– Stay simple: I wanted the game to be intuitive. That anyone can beat it without me teaching
                                them
                                the mechanics.<br>
                                – Force the player to use the all mechanics: It would be a wasted to introduce a new
                                mechanic
                                and neve use it again/don’t use it at all.</p>
                        <p>Both were my main headlines when designing the game.</p>
                        <p>Then I decided the main mechanic of the game: move the ball by tilting the ground. It will
                                allow the
                                ball to move thought the world. It is the most important mechanic of the game.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="divSeparation marginTop"

                        <div class="row">
                                        <h2 id="DesignEarly">Design (Early-Stage – Prototypes):</h2>
                                        <p>I was unfamiliar with the way unity manages physics. I only worked with tutorials and 2D
                                                projects
                                                before.</p>
                                        <p>I then imagined the behaviour of the ball relative to the ground I was aiming for. I wanted
                                                to ball
                                                to be easily movable. That if the player made a mistake, he/she can recover controls
                                                easily.
                                                Therefore, I decided the ball to have a small initial acceleration and a late terminal
                                                velocity.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>It was time to experiment with the ball’s Rigidbody and gravity.<br>
                                        </p>
                        <div class="col-md-6 row main-container">I came to design my first prototype: a ball in free fall
                                without
                                any commands.<p></p>
                                <p>I wanted to understand how the velocity component worked, it’s proprieties, and how
                                        we can
                                        impact that with collisions.</p>
                                <p>I played around with the weight of the ball and the gravity to find a good ball
                                        acceleration
                                        relative to an angle. I was aiming the ball to get 4 velocity (magnitude) from a
                                        resting
                                        position on a plane angle of 10 degrees before 5sec. Why these values? because I
                                        needed
                                        a reference for the game. I wanted to have a “feel” of it and then adjust on
                                        what I
                                        thought would be good.<br></p>

                                wall and doesn’t move afterwards. I understood that bouncing back from the wall wasn’t a

                                from the Rigidbody (or the material?). I explored a way to make the ball bounce with
                                another
                                prototype.<br>

                                reverse it and add it to the ball with the AddForce function. It was nice but not

                        <p>One of the hardest challenges I had to solve is the problem linked to the plane moving.<br>
                                Because the Update() function update itself every frame, the vertical displacement of
                                the plane,
                                made with a Quaternion.Slerp (lerp from a point a to b by a displacement t), is
                                dependant of the
                                SIZE of planes.</p>
                        <p>Let me explain: if the displacement of the plane per frame is less than the size of the
                                ball’s
                                collider, the ball will follow the plane such as bellow:</p>

                        <p>If the plane is too big, the displacement per frame increases. If it becomes bigger than the

                        <p>Same applies when you jump really close to a plane’s edge. The plane will reset to Quaternion
                                identity as the ball will exit the plane’s collider. The player will most likely keep
                                the button
                                pushed down, resulting to a similar situation. The player will sometimes fall off

                        <p>To solve this, I had no choice but to limit the plane length, limit the maximum rotation of

                        <p>Going back to my core objectives, I wanted to have a simple game. Now that I have my

                                jump. I hoped that these keys were intuitive enough to people.</p>
                        <p>I also added rotation and sound to tokens. I wanted to encourage the player to be curious and

                                toward them, then realise they needed to collect them with the text on top-right corner.

                        <p>I never was so wrong… I tested this game with many people, both gamers and non-gamers. None
                                could
                                understand how to play it without my help (and without frustration). The only noticeable

                        <p>– Changing platforms: (~70% of about 15 people) had trouble understanding that the velocity

                                ball carries even if the plane is not tilted. This is the first requirement to move
                                plane and a

                                that if
                                we jump without velocity, the ball will stay idle. Lot of people (mostly non-gamers) had

                                understanding that they needed to build velocity before jumping.</p>

                                might this time”. I witnessed people trying to force a jump without velocity over 10
                                times in a
                                raw, not searching for a different way to solve the puzzle.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, gamers kept trying new techniques. “It didn’t work if I keep pressing this
                                button,
                                let’s try to jump this time”. They ultimately got the answer at the end.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that this is one of the main impacts of video games on people: They train us to
                                explore
                                every option available from the gameplay to advance through the level. Gamers adapts
                                faster. If
                                something doesn’t work once, or twice… it won’t work at all.</p>
                        <p>That, sadly, doesn’t apply to the gameplay’s learning process. Everyone needs to be thought
                                the tools
                                to play the game first before thinking of different situation to apply it. It will be
                                hard (and
                                frustrating) to find the good tools alone, then apply them.</p>

                        <h2 id="Conclusion">Project: Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>This project was supposed to be about Level Design (which explains the name “Level”). I
                                wanted a Game
                                Design as simple as possible so the Level will bring the difficulty, the unexpected and
                                the fun.
                        </p>
                        <p>I was aiming to teach mechanics slowly, that once I introduce a new one I am sure that the
                                player
                                already masters the previous one. The Player could solve puzzles differently using the
                                skill set
                                as they wished (jump above lasers, or roll when it’s safe to do so, etc…).</p>
                        <p>I learnt a lot about problem solving, and also understood I couldn’t solve everything
                                perfectly. I
                                had to compromise with the level’s design to make sure it fits the core design
                                perfectly.</p>
                        <p>This project’s foundation is now complete. The puzzles can be created very easily, new
                                enemies with
                                different mechanics can be implemented and the game can now grow into a bigger, funnier
                                version
                                of itself. I might as well create a small story now… How about we go save a princess ;)?
